	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_CollectionInitiators.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_CollectionInitiators

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli

	PURPOSE: A simple lookup table mapping the IDs used for various "sections of code that trigger
		the collection of data". The ID is used in a number of tables, e.g. the AutoWho data collection
		tables, and allows the users of various sp_XR_* procs to choose whether they are reviewing 
		data captured by the standard AutoWho or ServerEye traces, or special "one-off" traces triggered
		through the sp_XR_* procs themselves.
