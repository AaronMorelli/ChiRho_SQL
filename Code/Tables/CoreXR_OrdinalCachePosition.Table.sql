	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_OrdinalCachePosition.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_OrdinalCachePosition

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli

	PURPOSE: Holds the current ordinal position within a given cache from the
	CaptureOrdinalCache table. An ordinal cache is identified by the combination
	of columns: StartTime/EndTime/session_id, and the CurrentPosition is valid
	for the range of ordinals found in CaptureOrdinalCache for the matching
	start/end/session_id.
