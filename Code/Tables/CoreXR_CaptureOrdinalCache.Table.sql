	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_CaptureOrdinalCache.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_CaptureOrdinalCache

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli
					aaronmorelli@zoho.com

					sqlcrossjoin.wordpress.com

	PURPOSE: Holds a list of capture times (e.g. for captures by the AutoWho or ServerEye components)
	and each capture time's order number (both ascending and descending) within the overall range. The
	front-end UI procs populate this table when requested by a user call, for a given start/end range,
	and then refer to it as they iterate over the capture times.
