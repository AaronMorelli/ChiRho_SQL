	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_DBIDNameMapping.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_DBIDNameMapping

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli

	PURPOSE: The various components of ChiRho typically store just the DBID.
	This table provides a mapping and serves as a type-2 dimension, handling
	changes over time.
