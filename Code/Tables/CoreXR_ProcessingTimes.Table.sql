	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_ProcessingTimes.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_ProcessingTimes

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli

	PURPOSE: Contains a list of tags (used by various components of the CoreXR
	system) and a "last processed" time for that tag, essentially recording the
	high watermark for various post-processing procedures that do analysis or
	data modification on already collected data.
