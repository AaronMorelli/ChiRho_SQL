	PROJECT NAME: ChiRho for SQL Server https://github.com/AaronMorelli/ChiRho_SQL

	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A T-SQL toolkit for troubleshooting performance and stability problems on SQL Server instances

	FILE NAME: CoreXR_Version.Table.sql

	TABLE NAME: CoreXR_Version

	AUTHOR:			Aaron Morelli
					aaronmorelli@zoho.com
					@sqlcrossjoin
					sqlcrossjoin.wordpress.com

	PURPOSE: One-row table with the current version of the ChiRho system (which is based on the version and type
	of the SQL Server instance that this installation of ChiRho is running on). This allows code in ChiRho to easily
	check for whether certain functionality (e.g. columns in a DMV) is available or not.
