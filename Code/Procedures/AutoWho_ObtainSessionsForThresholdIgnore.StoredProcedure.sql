*****
*****	PURPOSE: The AutoWho collector uses "threshold" parameters to determine whether certain, more-expensive
*****		activities (collecting query plans, input buffers, tran or lock info, etc) are required. If no SPIDs
*****		cross those thresholds on a given run, that extra info will not be collected. This strategy helps keep
*****		the collector as fast as possible while still capturing the important "extra" data when necessary. 
*****
*****		The main driver for these thresholds is spid (active or idle) duration. However, there are sessions that
*****		we know will be active all day (e.g. the AutoWho and Server Executor/Collector SPIDs), so we need to 
*****		exclude those sessions from the threshold calculation. This proc is called from @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.AutoWho_Executor every
*****		5 minutes and re-calcs the Session IDs.
