*****
*****	PURPOSE: sp_XR_SessionViewer is a "DMV aggregator", and displays the contents of a number of session-focused DMVs
*****		in one concise, intuitive interface. A large number of proc parameters and "clickable-XML" fields allow for
*****		a "drilldown" experience when the user wants to see data points that don't fit well onto a smaller amount
*****		of SSMS grid real estate. When running this tool, the user can view all non-trivial sessions that are active
*****		or (in the case when running in historical mode) were active at the time that AutoWho ran a snapshot.
*****
*****		*NOTE: in the current release, sp_XR_SessionViewer can *only* view historical data (collected by AutoWho); at some
*****		time in the future, this procedure will be able to view the current state of the system. 
*****
*****		Detailed help documentation is available by running
*****			EXEC sp_XR_SessionViewer @help=N'Y'

	FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS: 
		When I implement the live version of this proc, add several directives:
		- one to cause page latch resolution
		- one to suppress system spids
		- one to "showself" (i.e. not suppress @@spid)
		- one to do the "debug speed" logic, or equivalent for the "Messages" tab

		We have two different, but related, caching tables. 
			@@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.CoreXR_OrdinalCachePosition --> acts a bit like a cursor in the sense that it keeps track of which "position" the user is at currently 
				w/sp_XR_SessionViewer. An "ordinal cache" has a key of Utility name/CollectionInitiatorID/Start Time/End Time/session_id (spid of of the 
				user running sp_XR_SessionViewer). As the user repeatedly presses F5, the position increments by 1 each time (or decrements, if @offset = -99999 
				instead of the default 99999), and the position is stored in the OrdinalCachePosition table.

			@@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.CoreXR_CaptureOrdinalCache --> When a sp_XR_* proc first supplies a Utility/CollectionInitiatorID/Start Time/End Time (for this case, Utility="sp_XR_SessionViewer"), 
				the CaptureOrdinalCache is populated with all of the SPID Capture Time values between Start Time and End Time, for that CollectionInitiatorID. 
				That is, the @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.CoreXR_CaptureOrdinalCache will hold every run of the AutoWho.Collector between @start and @end inclusive. All of those capture 
				times are numbered from 1 to X and -1 to -X, in time order ascending and descending. Thus, given a number (e.g. 5), the table can be used to find 
				the Capture Time that is the 5th one in the series of captures starting with the first one >= @Start time, and ending with the last 
				one <= @End time. Or if the number is -5, the table can be used to obtain the Capture Time that is 5th from @End, going backwards towards @Start.
			
				As mentioned above, each time the user hits F5 to execute the proc, the position in @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.CoreXR_OrdinalCachePosition is incremented and returned/stored 
				in @lv__effectiveordinal, and then this position is used to probe into @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.CoreXR_CaptureOrdinalCache to find the Capture Time that corresponds to 
				the @lv__effectiveordinal in the @start/@end time series that has been specified. 

			This complicated design behind the scenes is to give the user a relatively simple experience in moving through time when examining AutoWho data.

			The CollectionInitiatorID field is a newer addition to this design. It basically partitions the various AutoWho tables and the above 2 Cache tables)
			into different data sets, depending on how the AutoWho.Collector was called. The value of 255 corresponds to the standard AutoWho "Executor" trace,
			which typically runs all day every 15 seconds. When a user executes sp_XR_SessionViewer in "current" mode (null start/end), then the AutoWho.Collector
			is run with a different CollectionInitiatorID value (1 in this case) and data is saved into the AutoWho tables with that initiator ID. 
		
			This allows the user of sp_XR_SessionViewer to go back and look at data they've seen through this proc. It also allows the functionality in
			sp_XR_QueryProgress that sits in a loop and snapshots every X seconds and then spits out a time-series analysis of a given query, allowing
			the user to start/stop a custom trace and view the data in aggregate or in detail.

sp_XR_SessionViewer version 2008R2.1

Key Concepts and Terminology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sp_XR_SessionViewer displays from AutoWho, a subcomponent of the ChiRho toolkit that collects data from the session-centric 
DMVs and stores that data in AutoWho tables. sp_XR_SessionViewer focuses on displaying one AutoWho collection (called a capture)
at a time, either from the "live" DMV data (known as "current mode") or from past collections ("historical mode"). This proc shows
all actively-running queries and idle SPIDs (depending on filtering criteria) for a given moment in time. It has cousins:
sp_XR_SessionSummary, which shows just 1 row per AutoWho capture and aggregated info about the DMV data at that capture time, 
and sp_XR_LongRequests, which shows for a given window of time requests that ran longer than X seconds and key info about those
requests. Forthcoming is sp_XR_QueryProgress, which allows the tracking of an individual query including detailed info about
parallel waits. 

The term "AutoWho" needs clarification: it is the subcomponent of the ChiRho toolkit focused on session-based DMV data,
and is a set of procs and tables that collect and store this data. On a typical install of ChiRho, the AutoWho code typically
executes in the context of a background trace, polling every 15 seconds. However, the same AutoWho collection code can be run by
sp_XR_SessionViewer whenever it is running in "current mode", and likewise for sp_XR_QueryProgress in current mode.
Regardless of which method is used to collect AutoWho data, it is always stored in AutoWho tables. Thus, even a "current mode"
run of sp_XR_SessionViewer or sp_XR_QueryProgress stores data from the DMVs into AutoWho tables before displaying to the user.
A tag in the AutoWho tables is used to differentiate which method of collection was used for each capture, essentially partitioning
(logically) the data into different "sets". The @source parameter allows the user to target these different sets.
This enables the playback of previous sp_XR_SessionViewer/QueryProgress captures and custom "one-off" polling traces. See more below.

Note that when sp_XR_SessionViewer is used to collect data (in current mode), it uses a different set of options than the standard
AutoWho background trace uses. Differences between the sets of options can cause differences in the amount of data collected,
through different thresholds or filters.

Parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@start			Valid Values: NULL, any datetime value in the past

				If NULL, directs sp_XR_SessionViewer to run in "current mode" (query and then return data from the live DMVs). 
				If @start is NULL, @end must also be NULL. If non-null, must be a time in the past, and must be < @end. Past times
				define the starting point of a time window for which past AutoWho data captures ("historical mode") will be displayed. 
				NOTE: see the @offset parameter below for more info on how this works.
	
@end			Valid Values: NULL, any datetime in the past more recent than @start

				If NULL, directs sp_XR_SessionViewer to run in "current mode" (query and then return data from the live DMVs).
				If @end is NULL, @start must also be NULL. If non-null, must be a time in the past, and must be > @start. Past times 
				define the ending point of a time window for which past AutoWho data captures ("historical mode") will be displayed. 
				NOTE: see the @offset parameter for more info on how this works.';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

	SET @helpstr = N'
@offset			Valid Values: NULL, any positive or negative integer from -99999 to 99999. (zero currently does nothing)

				When @start & @end are both NULL, @offset has no function and is ignored. When @start and @end times are specified, and 
				thus historical data is displayed, the @offset value defines which specific capture time is displayed. For example, 
				if @start is "2015-01-01 04:00:00.000" and @end is "2015-01-01 05:00:00.000", AutoWho capture times between the two 
				endpoints are numbered in order. Thus, in the example 1 hour timeframe just specified, "2015-01-01 04:00:00.000" would be 
				@offset=1, "2015-01-01 04:00:15.000" would be @offset=2, and so on all the way to "2015-01-01 05:00:00.000", @offset=240. 

				The user can thus move through the time range manually, by setting @offset first to 1, and then to 2, and so on, moving 
				"forward through time". He/she can also move backwards through time by using negative offsets. Thus, by starting with -1, 
				then -2, etc. he/she would start at "2015-01-01 05:00:00.000" and move to "2015-01-01 04:59:45.000", etc.';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

	SET @helpstr = N'
				Because manually changing the @offset each time would be slow and tiresome, the special values 99999 and -99999 tell 
				sp_XR_SessionViewer to go to the next @offset value forward or backward, respectively. The default value of @offset is 
				99999, and the default "position" starts at 1. Thus, when the user enters a @start and @end time range, he/she can just 
				hit F5 and move through time without micro-managing offsets. This is possible because the @offset value passed in is 
				stored internally in a permanent table, specific to the time range specified for the SPID of the user running sp_XR_SessionViewer.
				Offset functionality works the same regardless of the value of the @source parameter (next).
				
@source			Valid Values: "trace" (default), "pastSV", "pastQP" (all case-insensitive)

				As mentioned above, AutoWho code is used to capture DMV data whether the background trace is doing the collecting
				or sp_XR_SessionViewer/QueryProgress are collecting the live data and returning to the user. When sp_XR_SessionViewer
				is used in historical mode, @source allows the user to point to either data collected by the standard background trace
				(using "trace"), to data collected by past sp_XR_SessionViewer runs ("pastSV") or to data collected by past
				sp_XR_QueryProgress runs ("pastQP"). 

				When this proc is executed in current mode, @source is ignored.';

@camrate		Valid Values: 0 (default), any positive integer between 1 and 1800 (units is seconds)

				When in current mode, @camrate controls whether sp_XR_SessionViewer captures just one snapshot of current DMV data or

				If @camrate is > 0, DMV data is captured every @camrate seconds, as long as @camstop allows, and then instructions are 
				returned to the user on how to review the data.
				
@camstop		Valid Values: 60 (default), any positive integer between 10 seconds and 259200 seconds (3 days)

				In current mode or when @camrate=0, this parameter is ignored. Otherwise, @camstop defines how many seconds sp_XR_SessionViewer 
				will collect DMV data (every @camrate seconds). Thus, this helps to define a custom, one-off polling trace of DMV data.

@activity		Valid Values: 0, 1 (default), and 2

				Specifies which types of SPIDs the user wants to see. 0 means only SPIDs actively running a query/batch should be displayed. 
				1 is a superset of 0, and includes SPIDs that are idle (not running a query), but have a transaction open. 2 is a superset of 
				1, including SPIDs that are idle with no open transaction. Note that even if a SPID would normally be excluded, if it is 
				blocking an active spid that IS included, the excluded spid will still be included. Thus, when 0 is specified, idle spids 
				that are blockers are included. When 1 is specified, an idle spid with NO tran can still be included if it is blocking an 
				active spid, for example when the active spid is attempting to put a DB into single-user mode. 

				NOTE 1: Any spid with >= 64000 pages (500 MB) of currently-allocated tempdb space will automatically appear in sp_XR_SessionViewer 
				output regardless of whether it is actively running or has an open transaction. This threshold is controllable via the
				HighTempDBThreshold option.
				
				NOTE 2: when viewing historical/AutoWho data, an inclusive filter at display time is only as good as how inclusive AutoWho was 
				when it collected the data. For the @activity filter, its effectiveness is limited to what the AutoWho "IncludeIdleWithTran" 
				and "IncludeIdleWithoutTran" options are configured to.

@dur			Valid values: 0 (no duration filtering, the default), or any positive integer

				Directs sp_XR_SessionViewer to filter out spids with a duration shorter than @dur. For a spid running a query/batch, the duration
				is how long the batch has been running ("active duration"), defined as DATEDIFF(ms, dm_exec_requests.start_time, Capture Time). 
				For idle spids, this is defined as how long the spid has been idle ("idle duration"), defined as 
				DATEDIFF(ms, dm_exec_sessions.last_request_end_time, Capture Time). 

				NOTE: The @dur filter can only be as inclusive as the AutoWho collection-time "DurationFilter" option allows.

				Note that if the AutoWho options "ObtainQueryPlanForStatement" and "ObtainQueryPlanForBatch" are both "N", there will be no

				"QueryPlanThresholdBlockRel" options control how long (in milliseconds) a request must be running before its query plan is obtained. 

@ibuf			Valid values: Y or N (default)

				If "Y", causes the "InputBuffer" column to be included in the result set. This column is an XML value containing the results

@bchain			Valid values: 0 (default) through 10

				Controls how many levels deep for which the "blocking chain" graphical representation is constructed. The blocking chain is 
				an XML value that displays at the top of the sp_XR_SessionViewer result set, and contains a hierarchical structure (via 
				indentation) of the root blockers and their blocking chains. Since very deep blocking chains can be costly to construct 
				without much payoff (usually the first few levels are the most important), this parameter allows the user to specify how 
				deep to construct the chains. The parameter allows values of up to 10-deep, but of course the actual depth of the blocking 
				chain could be much shallower than 10 levels. 
				
				NOTE: The AutoWho option "BlockingChainDepth" controls how many levels of blockees are CAPTURED. Thus, if the AutoWho option is 
				4, then the max depth that can ever be displayed is 4, even if very deep blocking chains occurred in the SQL workload. The 
				AutoWho logic to capture the blocking chain data is only triggered once there has been a spid blocked for >= the 
				"BlockingChainThreshold" option.

				dm_exec_sessions.open_transaction_count > 0 or whose active or idle duration is >= the "TranDetailsThreshold" option in AutoWho.

@waits			Valid values: 0, 1, 2, or 3

				Values 0 through 2 control how much wait-type detail is displayed in the "Progress" column. (See the notes under the "Progress"

@savespace		Valid values: Y or N (default)

				When "Y", the column names are abbreviated to a shorter form, in order to condense the columns and reduce or eliminate the amount

@directives		Valid values: "query/ies"

				Think of "directives" as a bit like SQL trace flags. They are not necessarily documented fully, and change the  behavior of 
				sp_XR_SessionViewer in various ways that can change easily from release to release. They allow the developer of sp_XR_SessionViewer 
				to add in fringe features without committing to a change in the API. Over time, more valuable fringe features may be promoted via their 
				own parameter. As of this release, there is only one directive (besides debugging-related directives): adding the text "query" or "queries" 
				to the @directives parameter when querying historical/AutoWho data will cause the Current_Command field in the very top row to 
				contain a number of queries against the underlying AutoWho tables. This allows follow-up ad-hoc analysis.

Special Rows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conceptually, each output row from sp_XR_SessionViewer represents a session (aka spid). (To be completely accurate, each row represents a 
"request" that a spid is running, or the spid itself if it is idle. However, a spid will only have multiple rows if the MARS feature is in 
use, so most of the time it is sufficient to think of each row as a spid.

However, some information returned by sp_XR_SessionViewer is not directly tied to one and only one spid. Therefore, this information is 
displayed on "special spids" (internally represented with negative session_id values). These special rows usually provide click-able XML 
values that can bring special insight in certain scenarios.

It may be helpful to think of sp_XR_SessionViewer output as a "dashboard", with multiple sections. The top section contains "special rows" 
with special, non-spid-specific information. The next section contains system spids, if any qualify. The third section contains 
"active spids/requests", and the final section contains idle spids. The resulting rows are always ordered by these sections; thus, idle SPIDs 
will always sort lower than active user SPIDs, which will always sort lower than system SPIDs, which will always sort lower than the "special rows".

The secondary "order by" column is effectively "by duration descending". Thus, an active spid that has been running for 5 minutes will be nearer 
to the top than an active spid that has been running for 7.2 seconds. An spid that has been idle for 13.6 seconds will be nearer to the top 
than a spid that has been idle for 15 minutes (because idle durations can be thought of as "negative durations"). Future versions may reverse 
the idle sort order so that long-idle spids sort at the top of the idle section. Future versions may also give the user control over the sort 
order of the records (within, but not across, each of the four sections).

In this build of sp_XR_SessionViewer/AutoWho, the following "special rows" are possible: 

	CaptureTime --> It contains values for 3 columns:
						"SPID" --> The text "CapTime" is displayed, along with the current numerical offset: e.g. "CapTime[3]". See the notes 
									on the @offset parameter. For current mode, the offset for this special row is always 1.
						"SPIDContext" --> displays the exact capture time, down to the millisecond, when AutoWho captured the data. This allows 
										  easy copy-pasting into ad-hoc queries against the underlying AutoWho tables.
						"CurrentCommand" --> is empty, unless certain "extra" data is available. For example, the value:
											 "<?opt -- bchain trans waits3 --?>" indicates that Blocking Chain data, Transaction Info data, and 
											 Lock Details data are all available for this SPID Capture Time. This serves as an indicator to the 
											 user that they can utilize the "bchain", "tran", and "waits=3" parameters to view this extra info.';

	Blocking chains --> Displays an XML value (in the "CurrentCommand" column) that contains a textual, hierarchical representation of blocking 
						chains. Each root blocker appears left-justified, and each of its blockees appears indented underneath. Data from 
						dm_os_waiting_tasks is included to give more information about the locks involved.

	Lock Details	--> Displays a textual representation of the contents of dm_tran_locks, for relevant blocking/blockee spids. Relevant 
						blocking spids are those who are blocked >= "ObtainLocksForBlockRelevantThreshold" (AutoWho option) milliseconds, 
						and the spids that are blocking them. Note that in order to avoid displaying many rows of Row, Page, Key, or other 
						detail-level locks, the dm_tran_locks records are aggregated via COUNT(*) over all of the displayed columns, and 
						the count is reported in the "#Rows" column.

						Displaying this value can be time-consuming; when viewing historical/AutoWho data (when the DMV capture logic has 
						already happened previously and only display logic needs to occur), this is usually the cause of sp_XR_SessionViewer 
						executions that are longer than 1 or 2 seconds.

	Tasks W/O SPIDs	--> On very busy servers, the SQL Server thread pool can be exhausted and incoming requests can wait with the reason 
						"THREADPOOL". These incoming requests do not yet have their own SPID, so sp_XR_SessionViewer aggregates them into 
						a special row. The "#Tasks" column shows how many tasks are waiting on the THREADPOOL wait type.';

Columns
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPID			A composite field that usually just displays the session_id value from sys.dm_exec_sessions. For "special rows", either 
				"Cap Time", "Blk Chains", "Lock Details", or "Tasks W/O spids" is displayed. For the remaining rows, the composite field 
				is constructed as such:
					<blocking indicator> + <system spid indicator> + <session id> + <request ID>

				The session ID is always displayed. The other 3 indicators are only present if appropriate. Here are some examples: 
					72		--> a normal user session with the session_id value of "72". The spid may be idle or may be actively 
								running a batch. Use the "Duration" column to determine which.
					s14		--> the session_id is 14, and it is a system spid. System spids are only displayed when their 
								dm_exec_requests.wait_type status is DIFFERENT than their "typical" state. For example, the CHECKPOINT 
								spid''s normal wait type is "CHECKPOINT_QUEUE", as it waits to be woken up for explicit or automatic 
								checkpoints. The sp_XR_SessionViewer logic will only include the CHECKPOINT spid 
								(dm_exec_requests.command="CHECKPOINT") when its wait type is NOT "CHECKPOINT_QUEUE". Most other system spids 
								are the same way, such that the user can be confident that the presence of a system spid in the output is an 
								indicator that the system spid in question is doing real work rather than its normal state of sleeping.';

									root blocker. The exclamation mark can help the user quickly identify root blockers when much blocking 
									is occurring. 
					(!) s14		--> The system spid is a root blocker. This is rare, and in the author''s experience usually happens when the 
									CHECKPOINT system spid and a checkpoint running from a backup are contending over the same database. 
					* 271:2		--> SPID 271 is a blocker (but not a root one) and is running a request with a non-zero request_id. Most 
									requests run under sys.dm_exec_requests.request_id = 0, but when MARS is used or at least enabled,

SPIDContext		For the "CapTime" special row, displays the datetime value of when the AutoWho collector captured DMV data. For other special 
				rows, is empty. For true session rows, displays the database context that the SPID is executing in. This is 
				DB_NAME(sys.dm_exec_sessions.database_id). 

				Several caveats should be mentioned: First, some system SPIDs do not have a database context (database_id = 0), or have a DB 
				context equal to the resource database (32767). Empty strings are displayed for these. On occasion, a DB context cannot be 
				established (for various reasons) for the spid, and empty strings are used here as well. Finally, the SPIDContext is the 
				result of running DB_NAME() on the session database_id at the time that sp_XR_SessionViewer is called. Thus, if AutoWho 
				collects DMV data on Monday, and a database is detached and re-attached on Tuesday and receives a different database ID, 
				and sp_XR_SessionViewer is called on Wednesday for Monday''s data, the results of DB_NAME(old DB ID) will often make little 
				sense to the user. The design choice to store the DB ID instead of the name is due to the expense of calling DB_NAME on systems 
				that may have hundreds or thousands of SPIDs. This design choice may be re-evaluated in a later release.';

Duration		Presents the active duration [DATEDIFF(millisecond, dm_exec_requests.start_time, AutoWho capture time)] or the idle duration 
				[DATEDIFF(millisecond, dm_exec_sessions.last_request_end_time, AutoWho capture time)] of a system or user spid. The format 
				depends on the length of the duration:

					< 1 minute: <seconds>.<tenths of a second> --> 13.7
					< 1 day: HH:MM:SS --> 03:07:33
					>= 1 day: Day~HH:MM:SS --> 16~07:04:01	(this is most common with system spids and in those cases often approximates 
												SQL instance uptime)

				In order to easily distinguish active from idle spids, the duration for idle spids is prepended with a "minus" sign. Thus, 
				"-24.3", "-01:05:33", etc. In rare occasions, the dm_exec_requests.start_time and/or dm_exec_sessions.last_request_end_time 
				values can be "1900-01-01", and in these cases this field displays "???". Those scenarios are usually very transient.

				from the dm_os_waiting_tasks data: the blocked task (blocking_session_id IS NOT NULL and <> to the session id [e.g. 
				a CXPACKET wait]) with the longest wait_duration_ms value is the task that defines the blocking session ID for the 
				whole SPID. Note that blocking can be due not only to lock waits (wait_type = LCK_M_*), but also to certain types of 
				PAGELATCH or PAGEIOLATCH waits, and even RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE waits.';

ObjectName		For system SPIDs, displays the value of dm_exec_requests.command, indicating what area of the SQL engine''s code the system 
				spid is executing. For user spids that are idle or executing ad-hoc T-SQL, an empty string is displayed. For user spids 
				that are executing in a procedure, function, or trigger, the OBJECT_NAME(object_id) value is displayed, along with schema 
				information. (DB information is also included if the DB name of the object is different than the DB context presented in 
				the "SPIDContext" field). 

				The object_id value that is used to determine the proc/function/trigger name is obtained by calling the dm_exec_sql_text 
				DMF using the dm_exec_requests.sql_handle value. If the object_id value is NULL, the SPID is considered to be executing 
				ad-hoc T-SQL. When the sql_handle value is 0x0, but the spid is clearly active, this field displays the "?obj N/A?" value. 

				One exceptional case is encountered often enough to deserve special handling. Active spids sometimes have a dm_exec_requests.command 
				value of "TM REQUEST". Often, a tran-related wait type (such as "WRITELOG" or "DTC") is found in the dm_exec_requests wait_type 
				field, and the dm_exec_requests.sql_handle value is 0x0. When the command is "TM REQUEST", therefore, the value "(TMRQ)" is 
				appended to the object name (if any is present). Also, the wait type from dm_exec_requests is used in the "Progress" field 
				(see below) instead of using the one from dm_os_waiting_tasks. If this behavior occurs frequently enough, users may want to 
				evaluate the Disk IO latency for their T-log files, or the effects of distributed transactions on performance. ';

CurrentCommand	For special rows, displays a click-able XML value that provides important contextual info, such as blocking chains or lock 
				details. For the CapTime special row, displays (if applicable) which extra options are available to the user for the current 
				capture time. For idle spids, this value is always an empty string.

				For active user SPID rows, displays the current statement that is executed, obtained by calling the dm_exec_sql_text DMF using 
				the dm_exec_requests sql_handle, and applying the statement_start_offset and statement_end_offset values.  At the bottom of the 
				XML value is printed the surrogate key to the table that holds a unique copy of all SQL text captured by AutoWho. This allows in 
				depth research and debugging, as well as obtaining the sql_handle and offset values.

#Tasks			The number of tasks allocated to a specific running query. The special row "Tasks W/O SPIDs" holds a COUNT(*) from the 
				dm_os_waiting_tasks DMV for tasks with a NULL session_id and which are in the THREADPOOL wait. System spids and active spids 
				running a serial query plan will always have 1 in this column. Idle spids will always have an empty string. Active spids running 
				a parallel query plan will have a fluctuating number of tasks. For active user SPIDs, this # is a COUNT(*) (grouped by 
				session_id/request_id) of sys.dm_db_task_space_usage.

				The #Tasks column always reflects the # of tasks that were observed for a given active spid at the time that spid was observed. 
				However, that value can differ from the number of task rows saved to the @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.AutoWho_TasksAndWaits table for parallel queries for 
				2 reasons: 1) Unless a parallel query''s duration exceeds the "ParallelWaitsThreshold" AutoWho option, only its top task/wait 
				is saved to @@CHIRHO_SCHEMA_OBJECTS@@.AutoWho_TasksAndWaits. This saves on processing time and disk space, since shorter-lived parallel queries may not

Progress		This complex field is composed of several conditional parts: Pct complete + session status + rqst status + wait info. Each section 
				is described below.

					Pct Complete --> Exposes the dm_exec_requests.percent_complete, but only if the value is >= 0.001. Otherwise, an empty string.

					Session status --> The idea here is to show the dm_exec_sessions.status field if it is "interesting". When the session 
									status is "interesting", it is displayed in square brackets. For example, if an idle session has a status 
									of "Sleeping", that is expected and thus not very interesting. Ditto for an active session with a status 
									of "Running". System spids are "not interesting" if they are either "Sleeping" or "Running". All other 
									scenarios are considered "interesting", such as "Preconnect" or "Dormant" statuses, and active spids in 
									a "Sleeping" status or idle spids in a "Running" status. (Note that these last 2 cases are usually due 
									to timing-related issues. Even though the dm_exec_requests and dm_exec_sessions data is pulled in the 
									same query, the query plan gathers data from dm_exec_requests before it gathers the corresponding data 
									from the sessions view. Thus, there could be micro- or millisecond differences in the gather times, and 
									therefore apparent inconsistencies. These inconsistencies are not common, and can usually be ignored. The 
									user should be looking for unexpected patterns that are frequent in the data.) ';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

SET @helpstr = N'
					Request status --> This is very similar to the session status logic described above. However, the status is displayed in 
									curly brackets if interesting, and comes from dm_exec_requests.status. Nothing is ever displayed for idle 
									spids. Active spids in "Running" or "Suspended" status have an "uninteresting" status, as do system spids 
									that are in "Background" status. This leaves "Runnable" and "Sleeping" for all spids, and "Background" for 
									user spids. The author has not seen "Sleeping" or user-"Background" states, though "Runnable" is somewhat 
									common and, when seen for many spids at the same time can be an indicator of CPU contention.';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

SET @helpstr = N'
					Wait info --> The "wait info" portion is more complex, but before we can adequately describe its sub-parts, we need to 
								define the sources of "wait info" since they can vary under different circumstances. "Wait Info" can be thought 
								of as being derived from three different DMVs, (dm_exec_requests, dm_os_tasks, and dm_os_waiting_tasks), depending 
								on the status of the spid. Idle spids do not have data in any of these 3 DMVs, and therefore the "wait info" 
								portion is completely blank. Active spids executing a serial query plan have only 1 task, and thus only 1 row in 
								dm_os_tasks. That single task may or may not be waiting, and thus there may or may not be a corresponding row in 
								dm_os_waiting_tasks. (Note that there even could be MULTIPLE rows in dm_os_waiting_tasks for 1 dm_os_tasks task_address 
								value, in the event where SQL Server tracks multiple blockers for a given task.)

								An active spid executing a parallel query plan will usually have multiple sub-tasks, and thus multiple rows in 
								dm_os_tasks. These tasks will often have multiple records per task_address in dm_os_waiting_tasks. Thus, the 
								question of "which wait information to display" becomes complex quite quickly. Because of limited space in the 
								sp_XR_SessionViewer result set, the concept of a "most relevant task" is used and the sp_XR_SessionViewer output 
								uses that "top task" as the basis of the "wait info" portion. For active, serial queries, there is only 1 "top task" 
								and it is therefore the only one captured and stored. If that serial plan task has multiple rows in dm_os_waiting_tasks 
								(e.g. multiple blocker spids are being tracked), the one with the longest wait duration is used to define what the 
								wait_type and wait_duration_ms are. For parallel queries, the "top task" is defined using a scheme that prioritizes 
								certain waits or statuses higher/more important than other waits or statuses. "Non-top tasks" and waits are only 
								stored if the duration of the active request is >= the "ParallelWaitsThreshold" AutoWho option).';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

SET @helpstr = N'				Here is the priority order for defining the "top task": 
									1. LCK_M_* waits (waiting for a lock)
									2. Latch waits with a non-null blocking_session_id (that is <> the session_id column)
									3. PAGE/PAGEIO latch waits with a null blocking_session_id
									4. "Catch-all" bucket for anything not in categories 1 through 3, or 5 or 6.
									5. CXPACKET waits 
									6. A running task (i.e. not waiting)

								Thus, even if a parallel query has CXPACKET waits of 10 seconds and PAGEIO latch waits of 1 second, and a lock 
								wait of 3 milliseconds, the lock wait will get top priority, and that task/wait info will be shown. An active 
								spid executing a parallel query will only have a blank "wait info" section if ALL tasks are running (this is 
								not common), and it will only show a CXPACKET wait if all tasks are either in CXPACKET waits or running. This 
								reflects the fact that CXPACKET waits do not, by themselves, indicate that a query is truly blocked, stuck, or 
								otherwise unable to progress.';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

SET @helpstr = N'				The above logic based on finding the "top task" in dm_os_tasks and dm_os_waiting_tasks does have two important 
								exceptions: For system spids, or a user spid with a dm_exec_requests.command="TM REQUEST", then the wait type is 
								taken from dm_exec_requests. This is because both types of activities usually involve shorter waits, and it is 
								possible, even likely, that the short time gap in between when dm_exec_requests and dm_os_waiting_tasks are 
								accessed (separate queries) will produce confusing and inconsistent data. Of course, when the dm_exec_requests.wait_type 
								column is used, the dm_exec_requests.wait_duration column is used as well. "TM REQUEST" spids often have a 
								WRITELOG or DTC-related wait associated with them. 

								Now that we have described the source of the "wait info" portion, we can describe its format.
								Each individual wait uses the structure: "wait tag / duration indicator". Consider these 3 examples: 
									WAITFOR  = 8719ms
									WAITFOR  --> 14.6sec <--
									BACKUPTHREAD  = 7813ms
								In all three cases, the "wait tag" is simply just the wait_type value. In 2 of the 3 cases, the duration is less 
								than 10000 milliseconds, and thus an "=" character is used. For the wait that is >= 10000 milliseconds, "arrows" 
								have been used to draw attention to the longer wait. ';
	RAISERROR(@helpstr,10,1);

SET @helpstr = N'
								When the @waits parameter is 0, the "wait tag" is just wait_type. However, @waits=1 and @waits=2 add more 
								information for some common wait types. Consider: 
									CXPACKET  = 103ms					(@waits=0)
									CXPACKET:PortOpen:3  = 103ms		(@waits=1 or 2)
								The increased detail gives us the "CXPACKET sub-type" and the node ID (3) that it is occurring on. Anothor example:
									PAGEIOLATCH_SH  = 0ms										(@waits=0)
									PAGEIOLATCH_SH{myDB1 1:*}  = 0ms							(@waits=1)
									PAGEIOLATCH_SH{myDB1 ObjId:955150448, IxId:1}  = 906ms		(@waits=2)
								The middle row gives us the DB name and the file ID # for the page that is being waited on. If the page was a 
								special system bitmap, an acronym like "GAM" or "PFS" would appear instead of the asterisk. The last row gives 
								us the actual object id and index id that the page belongs to. This output is only possible if the AutoWho 
								option "ResolvePageLatches" is set to "Y".

								Finally, consider an example involving locking. 
									LCK_M_S  = 2401ms											(@waits=0)
									OBJECT{req:S held:IX }  = 2401ms							(@waits=1)
									OBJECT{req:S held:IX }{dbid:10 id:1109578991}  = 2401ms		(@waits=2)
								Both @waits=1 and @waits=2 tell us what type of lock is requested (an "OBJECT" lock, e.g. a table), that 
								it is requested in "S" mode (an S-lock on a table object is a table-level lock), and that it is held in 
								"IX" mode, which is incompatible with table-level S-locks. When @waits=2, we can even tell which DB and 
								object it is. The final output is only available if the AutoWho option "ResolveLockWaits" is set to "Y".';

QueryMem_MB		The amount of memory, in MB, requested or granted to the active request. If the memory has been granted, the value comes from 
				dm_exec_memory_grants.granted_memory_kb. If the memory has NOT yet been granted, the text "(Req)  " is prepended and the value 
				comes from dm_exec_memory_grants.requested_memory_kb. If the value is 0, an empty field is displayed.

				More granular information about the SPID''s query memory usage is available in the "Resources" field.

TempDB_MB		The amount of TempDB space, in MB, that the SPID is currently using. This is calculated by taking each "pair" in 
				dm_db_session_space_usage and dm_db_task_space_usage and subtracting the dealloc field from the alloc field. If the result 
				is < 0, it is floored at 0. The results from each pair are then added together to find the total current usage.

				The "lifetime allocation" is also calculated (i.e. just adding the 4 "alloc" fields), and if the value is >= 50 MB, the 
				text " /a: " is appended and then followed by the total allocation. This can help identify SPIDs that have allocated much 
				tempdb and then quickly deallocated it. Such allocation "spikes" can identify short-but-intensive requests.

				If an empty field is displayed, the current usage is 0 and the "lifetime allocation" is < 50 MB (and may be 0 also). More 
				granular information about the SPID''s TempDB usage is available in the "Resources" field.

CPUTime			For active SPIDs, the value from dm_exec_requests.cpu. For idle spids, the value from dm_exec_sessions.cpu. If the value 
				is 0, an empty field is displayed.

PhysicalReads_MB	For active SPIDs, the value from dm_exec_requests.reads. For idle spids, the value from dm_exec_sessions.reads. If 
				the value is 0, an empty field is displayed.

LogicalReads_MB		For active SPIDs, the value from dm_exec_requests.logical_reads. For idle spids, the value from dm_exec_sessions.logical_reads. 
				If the value is 0, an empty field is displayed.

Writes_MB		For active SPIDs, the value from dm_exec_requests.writes. For idle spids, the value from dm_exec_sessions.writes. If the 
				value is 0, an empty field is displayed.';

				written to the transaction log(s) by the transaction(s).

Resources		When @resources is set to "Y", this column displays an XML value for each user SPID. This XML contains detailed info on TempDB 
				allocations/deallocations, memory request and grant information, CPU and IO info, and a few other odds and ends.

BatchText		If AutoWho has been configured to capture the full Batch text for running SPIDs (via the "ObtainBatchText" option), and the 
				@batch parameter has been set to "Y", then sp_XR_SessionViewer returns a column named "BatchText" that holds the complete text of

					- @plan="statement":
						1. The "ObtainQueryPlanForStatement" AutoWho option must have been on for the capture time being displayed.

						   (OFF by default)
						2. #2 and #3 above are also requirements here

InputBuffer		This column is only present if the @ibuf parameter has been set to "Y". Spids with an active or idle duration >= the
